.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to verify and/or recover as much data as possible from failed
disks.
.Pp
The idea is to read all sectors of a disk and let the disk reallocate bad
or soon to be bad sectors.
While the disk is being read it can clone the data to a file or a disk as well.
The resulting disk/file can be checked with
.Xr fsck 8
and analyzed with
.Xr dumpfs 8
and
.Xr fsdb 8
while not having to deal with a failing disk.
.Pp
When a sector can not be read it will be filled with zeroes and
.Nm
continues on to the next sector.
For all intents and purposes this is a fancy
.Xr dd 1
that takes some of the complexity out of dealing with a failed disk.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl R Ar results file
Write the results of the rescue process to the specified file.
.It Fl b Ar block size
This is the block size that the disk uses to read and write data.
A large value speeds things up and once a bad spot on the disk is hit
.Nm
reverts to the natural block size of 512 bytes during the recovery process.
Default is 512, which is very slow!
The argument accepts the following quantifiers: b, k, m, g and the following
multipliers: * and x.
For example 1 mega byte can be expressed as: -b 1m or -b 1k*1k
.It Fl o Ar out file or disk
This is the target file or disk of the operation.
.It Fl q
Don't report completion percentage.
.It Fl r Ar raw disk
This is the raw disk device that will be attempted to be recovered.
For example: /dev/rsd2c
.It Fl v
Print version number and exit.
.It Ar operation
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm verify
The verify operation reads the entire disk and lets it do its thing to
reallocate bad or questionable blocks.
.It Cm recover
Essentially the same as verify but write the read data to a file or disk.

was written to recover a disk of a friend and it became useful enough for
the general public.

.Sh DISCLAIMER
Use this at your own risk!
Recovering disks can make them worse and the author takes no responsibility
for any data loss or corruption.
Also when used wrong a good disk could be overwritten permanently losing
all data on it.
Use this tool wisely and leave the author alone if you mess up.
.Sh BUGS
Lots of features are still missing.
